## **Database Schema**

The database schema consists of several tables that are interrelated to manage restaurant data, including information on categories, locations, ratings, and operational hours. Below is a breakdown of each table and its relationships.

## 1. `places` Table
This table stores information about restaurants or dining places.

### Key Columns:
- **id**: Primary key of the table.
- **category_id**: Foreign key referencing the `categories` table (indicating the restaurant's category).
- **kecamatan_id**: Foreign key referencing the `kecamatan` table (indicating the location of the restaurant).

### Relationships:
- **One-to-Many** with `categories`: A category can be associated with many restaurants.
- **One-to-Many** with `kecamatan`: A kecamatan (district) can have many restaurants.
- **One-to-Many** with `ratings`: A restaurant can have many ratings.
- **One-to-Many** with `operatinghours`: A restaurant can have multiple operating hours.

---

## 2. `categories` Table
This table stores information about food or restaurant categories, such as Food, Drinks, etc.

### Key Columns:
- **id**: Primary key of the table.
- **name**: Name of the category.

### Relationships:
- **One-to-Many** with `places`: A category can be used by many restaurants. This relationship is defined by the `category_id` in the `places` table.

---

## 3. `kecamatan` Table
This table stores data about districts (kecamatan).

### Key Columns:
- **id**: Primary key of the table.
- **name**: Name of the district.

### Relationships:
- **One-to-Many** with `places`: A district can have many restaurants. This relationship is defined by the `kecamatan_id` in the `places` table.

---

## 4. `ratings` Table
This table stores restaurant ratings and the number of reviews.

### Key Columns:
- **id**: Primary key of the table.
- **place_id**: Foreign key referencing the `places` table (indicating the restaurant being rated).
- **rating**: Rating value of the restaurant (decimal number).
- **reviews**: Number of reviews for the restaurant.

### Relationships:
- **Many-to-One** with `places`: Many ratings are associated with one restaurant.

---

## 5. `operatinghours` Table
This table stores the operating hours for each restaurant based on the day.

### Key Columns:
- **id**: Primary key of the table.
- **place_id**: Foreign key referencing the `places` table (indicating the restaurant).
- **day**: The operational day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
- **opening_time**: Opening time of the restaurant.
- **closing_time**: Closing time of the restaurant.

### Relationships:
- **Many-to-One** with `places`: Many operating hours are associated with one restaurant.

---

## Relationships Between Tables

- **`places`** is the central table:
  - It connects to the `categories` table through the `category_id`.
  - It connects to the `kecamatan` table through the `kecamatan_id`.
  - It connects to the `ratings` table through the `place_id`.
  - It connects to the `operatinghours` table through the `place_id`.

- **`categories`** serves as a reference for restaurant categories, used in the `places` table to categorize restaurants.
- **`kecamatan`** serves as a reference for the location of each restaurant, stored in the `places` table.
- **`ratings`** stores feedback on each restaurant and links to `places` via the `place_id`.
- **`operatinghours`** stores the operational hours of each restaurant and is connected to `places` via the `place_id`.

## **How to Run Locally**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kulinerkita/CC.git
   cd ML-Backend-API
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
